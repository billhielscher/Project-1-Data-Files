<p>Hiel Park is a privately owned campground that opened up in 1907. One of the very first visitors to camp here with his friends is <span style="font-weight: bold">William Sims.</span> Unfortunately, the names of the other men were forgotten and the records were lost when the administration building was tore down to make room for a more modern one. Mr. William Sims is the man partially standing in the center according to my grandfather.</p>
