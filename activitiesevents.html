<p style="margin-right: 20px"><span style="color: #black; font-weight: bold">Camping:</span> The crisp, clear evenings are perfect for a long night’s sleep. Camping is available at the Boone, Bowie and Colonel Sanders Creek of Hiel Park. All of the camping is primitive in nature and campers must walk to the sites. Boat-in camping on the Long Arm Peninsula is expected to be available in early 2015. Reservations are strongly recommended for camping.</p>

<p><span style="text-align: center; color: #black; font-weight: bold">Hiking and Biking:</span>Taking a hike or a bike ride on the extensive trail system at Hiel Park is a great way to enjoy the outdoors at your own pace. A walk in the spring when the air is scented with sweet wild azalea and rhododendron blossoms or a stroll in the fall when the leaves are ablaze in colors is tonic for the soul. There are hiking trails throughout Hiel Park.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold">Fishing:</span>The cool mountain waters of the Linville and Catawba rivers and Colonel Sanders Creek flow into the depths of Lake Boone and Bowie, creating a perfect environment for the many gamefish that swim here. Largemouth bass, walleye, white bass, crappie, bluegill, redbreast sunfish, muskellunge, carp, perch and catfish are all found in the lake. A fishing license is required and all anglers must adhere to the regulations of the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission.</p>
